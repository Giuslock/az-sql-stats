## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- Azure PowerShell module
- Connect-AzAccount cmdlet

## Usage

1. Connect to Azure using the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet
2. Run `az-sql-stats.ps1`

By default, the program outputs a CSV file called `az-sql-stats.csv` in the current working directory. The CSV file contains the following information for each SQL server:

- Subscription Name
- Resource Group Name
- SQL Server Name
- Firewall Rule Name
- Start IP Address
- End IP Address

If you would like to specify a different output file path, you can do so by passing the `-OutputFilePath` parameter when running the program.
